<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

As an electrical engineering student, I'm well-aware that just getting the degree isn't nearly enough to set yourself apart when looking for a job or an internship, <em>especially</em> not in this job market.
A common strategy to counter that is to work on personal projects in your free time, but I'm also an engineer, so I may as well use that as a chance to fix a problem in my life. Enter the Pomocube.

### What the hell is a pomodoro?

Named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer, the pomodoro technique is a way to stay focused for long periods of time. You work for 25 minutes, then take a 5 minute break, and repeat the process 3 more times, with a longer break at the end.
By taking small, regular breaks, you allow your attention-span to recharge, keeping you more productive overall. Plus, you always have a small reward to look forward too. Everyone is obviously different, but I have personally had
great success with this technique both to study and work.

Of course, there are a lot of pomodoro apps out there, and I've used my share over the years (my favorite is https://www.flow.app/).
With that said, you may wonder why I'm taking on this project. Here are a couple of reasons:

* I need a personal project, and this strikes a perfect balance between simplicity, relevance, and usefulness.
* Desktop pomodoro apps often take up valuable screen real-estate, and sometimes don't sync between platforms.
* Phone apps consume precious battery, require a stand and force you to keep your phone near you.
* Regardless of the device used, you're downloading <em>yet another app</em>, and I'm SICK of apps.

That's when I started thinking about creating a cute little physical timer that's stylish, delightful to use and can be carried anywhere.
I want the device to be simple and single-purpose, a short reprieve from today's hyper-connected slabs of glass and metal.
Here's a quick little render of what I picture the final version looking like:

Engineering and learning both take time, so I chose to work in iterations rather than try to reach this final result right away. This first prototype aims to 
implement some basic functionality. Later revisions will use different parts and feature extended functionality.

## Parts Selection

Continuing the theme of simplicity, this project requires very few parts.

### Microcontroller - ATmega328P (With Arduino Uno R3)

Yes, I'm using an Arduino Uno R3. 

### Display - 0.96" SSD1306 Monochrome OLED



### Rotary Encoder - KY-40

This rotary encoder is the only form of input for this device. No touch screen!

### Passive Buzzer

It's... the one that came with my Arduino starter kit. It gets the job done.
