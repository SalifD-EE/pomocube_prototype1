<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

As an electrical engineering student, I'm well-aware that just getting the degree isn't nearly enough to set yourself apart when looking for a job or an internship, <em>especially</em> not in this job market.
A common strategy to counter that is to work on personal projects in your free time, but I'm also an engineer, so I may as well use that as a chance to fix a problem in my life. Enter the Pomocube.

### What the hell is pomodoro?

Named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer, the pomodoro technique is a way to stay focused for long periods of time. You work for 25 minutes, then take a 5 minute break, and repeat the process 3 more times, with a longer break at the end.
By taking small, regular breaks, you allow your attention-span to recharge, keeping you more productive overall. Plus, you always have a small reward to look forward too. Everyone is obviously different, but I have personally had
great success with this technique both to study and work.

Of course, there are a lot of pomodoro apps out there, and I've used my share over the years (my favorite is https://www.flow.app/).
With that said, you may wonder why I'm taking on this project. Here are a couple of reasons:

* I need a personal project, and this strikes a perfect balance between simplicity, relevance, and usefulness.
* Desktop pomodoro apps often take up valuable screen real-estate, and sometimes don't sync between platforms.
* Phone apps consume precious battery, require a stand and force you to keep your phone near you.
* Regardless of the device used, you're downloading <em>yet another app</em>, and I'm SICK of apps.

That's when I started thinking about creating a cute little physical timer that's stylish, delightful to use and can be carried anywhere.
I want the device to be simple and single-purpose, a short reprieve from today's hyper-connected slabs of glass and metal.
Here's a quick little render of what I picture the final version looking like:

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
5. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```
